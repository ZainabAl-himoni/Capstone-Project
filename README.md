## 📚 **Project Title: Library Management System (LMS)**

### 🧠 **Overview**

The **Library Management System (LMS)** is a Django-based web application designed to manage books within a digital library.
It allows the **Admin** user to add books with detailed information such as title, author, price, number of pages, status, category, rating, and description — as well as upload book cover images.
The system focuses on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through Django’s admin panel and a simple, responsive HTML/CSS interface.

### 🧮 **Example Query Logic**

Display all books:

```python
books = Book.objects.all().order_by('title')
```

Filter books by category:

```python
books = Book.objects.filter(category__name='Science')
```

Display only available books:

```python
books = Book.objects.filter(status='available')
```

### 🌟 **Stretch Goals (Optional Enhancements)**

* Add a **book rental system** with time tracking.
* Add a **search bar** (by title or author).
* Include a **rating system** for books.
* Add **pagination** for large collections.
* Add **role-based permissions** (sub-admins).
* Implement a **visual dashboard** with statistics.

### 🧾 **Challenges & Solutions**

| Challenge                           | Solution                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Handling image uploads              | Configured `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` in settings.py.              |
| Defining book-category relationship | Used `ForeignKey` with `on_delete=models.PROTECT`.                   |
| Customizing admin interface         | Changed admin site title to *Library Management System Admin Panel*. |
| Displaying book images in admin     | Used `list_display` and media configuration to show images properly. |

### 🧠 **Future Improvements**

* Build a **modern frontend** using React or Vue.js instead of relying only on Django Admin.
* Add **user registration and login** for normal users (not just admin).
* Implement a **real book borrowing system** with deadlines and late fees.
* Create an **Analytics Dashboard** showing statistics by category or status.
* Allow **PDF file uploads** in addition to book images.
* Add an **Author model** to link multiple books to one author.
